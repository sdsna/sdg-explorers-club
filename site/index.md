In 2015, the 193 Member States of the United Nations adopted the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), an ambitious and universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that people everywhere enjoy peace and prosperity. But the SDGs aren’t just for governments. They call on all of us — from world leaders to schoolchildren — to learn about the threats to our world, and to take meaningful action both at home and abroad.

The **SDG Explorers Club** takes you on a hunt across NYC to discover the SDGs in museums, parks, and even your own neighborhood! Where will you #FindYourSDGs?

## Start Exploring


## We are looking for partners!
Interested in becoming a partner institution for our Explorers? Ideal anchor partners would be large institutions, as well as smaller programs with a dedicated interest in sustainable development topics such as urban planning, sustainable design, food, climate science, etc. We intend to market the SDG Explorers to schools and afterschool programs, scout troops, Boys & Girls Clubs, etc., and to students of sustainability at all levels, as well as through our contacts at universities, research institutions, local government, and the UN System. Contact Shannon Kobran today for more information.
